Please write an application that will:

Allow the user to provide a path to a directory
Find all text files in that directory and its children
If it encounters a compressed archive, open it and process any text files inside
Output a histogram of the word counts for the files

You may use any resources (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), tools and libraries, and write in any language. All we ask is that you design and write the code

Please feel free to ask questions, including about the requirements or for feedback on code.  You should do this as if you were a consultant to Maana, and received this request as a project – show us how you’d go about completing it.



Checklist
    get exts right
    deal with identically named files

Third step: write a fn to return word counts
Fourth step: Unzipping

Init - from path
   Path
   Wc_dict (ignoring full path for now)
   Zips - list of filepaths that are zipped

UT: test_init: bad directory error

Open_zips()
   Going thru the path, will unzip zip files and register them

UT: test_open_zips. Copies a multi level directory with zips. Walks the new directory, asserting for several zip files that their old zip is there, the new zips are there with nonempty files, and it is registered. Deletes copied dir

Close_zips()
   Going thru the path, will delete the directories and un-register them


Temporarily read in zip? Explore

UT: test_close_zips(). Given a directory with identical opened and zipped files, and a registry. Assert it deletes the open ones and leaves a shorter registry

Populate_wc_dict()
   Going thru the files, does read_file to and adds the word counts to the wc_dict

Read_file(file)
   Given a file, returns how many words

   Twst_read_file. Given a couple files with tricks, asserts correct word counts

Quick_hist()
   Histogram of word counts

Write_to_sql()
   Don't actually do this
